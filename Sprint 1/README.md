## Analyze the dataset for CECS551_dataset_01
### Perform exploratory data analysis using Python for dataset_01. Please use the right data visualization method for specific problem statement (choose the right chart type, for example, boxplot, histogram, scatterplot, pie-chart, etc.).
- Identify the key variables for the model using correlation plots, heatmaps, histograms, feature importance (SHAP).
- For the first 10 stores visualize the weekly and monthly sales patterns for top 35% of the product sales and department sales. 
-- Identify the best department and product “type” across the first ten stores.
- Investigate the relationship between weekly sales over CPI and unemployment for the first 10 stores. You can explore the what-if scenarios while writing the report.
- Investigate the impact of various types of discounts, for example, discount promotional, discount clearance, discount damaged good, discount competitive and discount employee on the overall sales.
-- Which type of discount is helpful in increasing the sales? Consider top 30% of the best performing stores (sales per 1000 square feet).
-- Does the observed behavior hold true for all the stores? Consider bottom 30% of the least performing store (sales per 1000 square feet).
- Identify the “type” of products which are highly impacted by external factors: “temperature”, “gas price”, and “holiday”. Is there any correlation between overall sales and holiday?


## Analyze the dataset for CECS551_dataset_02

### The dataset represents the unit sales (in number/quantity) of various products sold in the USA, organized in the form of grouped time series. More specifically, the dataset involves the unit sales of around 3000 products, classified in 3 product categories (Hobbies, Foods, and Household), and 7 product departments in which the above-mentioned categories are disaggregated. 
### The products are sold across 10 stores, located in 3 States (CA, TX, and WI). In this respect, the most disaggregated data, i.e., product- store unit sales, can be grouped based on either location (store and state) or product-related information (department and category). 

- Use Tableau to visualize the dataset_02.
- Publish the Tableau dashboard on public server.
