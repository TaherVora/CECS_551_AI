# Sprint 3: Model deployment and business recommendation (30 points)

## The work of a Data Scientist does not end by designing an accurate model with historical data. The model should also be deployed for the end user and provide some decision making for business refinement. Sprint 3 deals with addressing these problems.


### 1. Deploy the machine learning model using Streamlit (https://github.com/streamlit) for dataset_02 (ARIMA) 

### 2. Product segmentation based on demand variability (ABC Analysis).(dataset_02)



#### Tasks -

- Use first year data of Household category to create ABC Analysis and interpret the graph. 
- How stable is the customersâ€™ demand? (Coefficient of Variation)
- To understand which products will bring planning and distribution challenges, compute the coefficient of variation of the yearly distribution of sales of each reference. 
- Discuss a few initiatives and recommendations for improving the retail business for dataset_02.
